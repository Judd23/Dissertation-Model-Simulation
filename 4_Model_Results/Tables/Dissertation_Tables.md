PART I: SAMPLE AND DATA QUALITY

Table 1

Sample Flow and Analytic Sample Size by Treatment Group and Cohort

Note. FASt = ≥12 transferable dual credit units at matriculation; Lite_DC = 1–11 credits; No_Cred = 0 credits. Cohort 2022-23 = fall 2022 first-time freshmen; Cohort 2023-24 = fall 2023. ESS = effective sample size after propensity score overlap weighting.

Table 2

Descriptive Statistics for Study Variables

Note. n = sample size; M = mean; SD = standard deviation. FASt = ≥12 transferable credits; Lite_DC = 1–11 credits; No_Cred = 0 credits.

Table 3

Missing Data Rates by Variable

Note. Missing data assumed MAR (missing at random) and handled via FIML (full information maximum likelihood) in lavaan. Percentages reflect proportion of cases with missing values on each variable.

PART II: PROPENSITY SCORE WEIGHTING DIAGNOSTICS

Table 4

Propensity Score Model: Logistic Regression Predicting FASt Status

Note. Treatment: FASt = 1 (≥12 credits), non-FASt = 0 (Lite_DC + No_Cred). B = unstandardized coefficient; SE = standard error; OR = odds ratio. All continuous predictors mean-centered. Model used for computing overlap (ATO) weights.

Table 5

Covariate Balance Before and After Propensity Score Weighting

Note. SMD = standardized mean difference (FASt − non-FASt). VR = variance ratio (FASt / non-FASt). Non-FASt = Lite_DC + No_Cred combined. Balance achieved when |SMD| < 0.10 and VR between 0.80–1.25.

Table 6

Propensity Score Overlap Weight Diagnostics

Note. FASt = ≥12 credits; Non-FASt = Lite_DC (1–11) + No_Cred (0). Overlap weights: w = 1 − PS for treated, w = PS for control. ESS = effective sample size = (Σw)²/Σw². P5/P95 = 5th/95th percentiles; Mdn = median.

PART III: MEASUREMENT MODEL

Table 7

Confirmatory Factor Analysis: Standardized Factor Loadings

Note. λ = standardized factor loading; SE = standard error. ω = McDonald's omega reliability; AVE = average variance extracted. All loadings p < .001. Marker-variable identification used.

Table 8

Measurement Invariance Tests Across Treatment Groups

Note. Invariance tested for EmoDiss, QualEngag, and DevAdj factors. ΔCFI > −.010 and ΔRMSEA < .015 indicate acceptable invariance. Scalar invariance required for latent mean comparisons.

Table 9

Structural Equation Model Fit Indices

Note. Estimator: MLR with robust standard errors. Missing data: FIML. Bootstrap: B = 2,000 replicates. Acceptable fit: CFI/TLI ≥ .90, RMSEA ≤ .08, SRMR ≤ .08.

PART IV: STRUCTURAL MODEL RESULTS

Table 10

Structural Path Coefficients From Bootstrap Analysis

Note. X = FASt status; Z = credit dose (centered); M₁ = Emotional Distress; M₂ = Quality of Engagement; Y = Developmental Adjustment. B = unstandardized coefficient; β = fully standardized coefficient.

*95% percentile CI excludes zero. Bootstrap B = 2,000.

Table 11

Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects at Mean Credit Dose

Note. Effects evaluated at mean credit dose (Z = 0). Indirect effect = product of a-path and b-path coefficients. B = unstandardized; β = fully standardized.

*95% percentile bootstrap CI excludes zero. B = 2,000.

Table 12

Conditional Indirect Effects and Index of Moderated Mediation

Note. Conditional indirect effects evaluated at −1 SD, mean, and +1 SD of credit dose. IMM = index of moderated mediation = a₁z × b (slope of indirect effect on moderator). B = unstandardized; β = fully standardized.

*95% percentile bootstrap CI excludes zero. B = 2,000 replicates.

PART V: ROBUSTNESS AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSES

Table 13

Robustness Checks: Comparison Across Estimation Methods

Note. Weighted = overlap (ATO) weights; Unweighted = no propensity adjustment; IPTW = inverse probability of treatment weights. Difference = |Weighted − Unweighted|.
